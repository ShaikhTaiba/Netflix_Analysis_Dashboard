## Objectives

- Analyze and visualize Netflix's content trends using Python and Power BI  
- Identify the distribution between Movies and TV Shows  
- Extract and visualize the most common genres available on Netflix  
- Show the number of titles added year by year to track Netflix's content growth  
- Handle missing data and engineer a `year_added` feature  
- Build an interactive dashboard that communicates key insights clearly

## Tools Used

- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for code-based EDA and plotting  
- **Power BI**: for creating an interactive and visually rich dashboard  
- **GitHub**: for version control and project sharing
